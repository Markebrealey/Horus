# The Challenge 

Each team has identical resources, including sample documents from three ficticious suppliers (ABC generics, Nueryon and Oscorp).  The aim of the challenge is to train a forms Recognizer model using a subset of the documents, and then use that model to recognize and capture the data from the other documents in the document set.

Points are awarded as follows:

* 250 points for getting started and deploying the infrastructure
* 1500 points (approx) for training a model for each document format
* 100 pints for a 100% accutately recognised document.  There are 75 documents = 7500 points.

So, if you can train three models well enough to get 100% of the data on each form fully recognised, then you could get up to 10,000 points!  At the start of the challenge (and depnding on the available time), we will agree the end criteria.  The winner may be the team with the most points at a given time, or it could be the first to 9000 points.
