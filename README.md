# Horus

Is a forms recognition engine based on Microsoft Azure.  In simple terms, horus enables you train a forms recognizer model based on some sample documents, and then use that model to process document images to translate the data they contain into structured data. This is very early documentation - expect it to evolve significantly over the coming months.

Horus can be used for the Horus challenge - where teams compete against each other the get the highest quality recognition from a standard set of documents, or it can be used simply as a jump start for your own processing.  Currently these instructions are written for the challenge - but if you are interested in getting started on your own documents ASAP, then please contact me **nickdothillatmicrosoft.com** and I'll let you know how to go it alone.
