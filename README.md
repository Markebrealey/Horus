# Horus

Is a forms recognition engine based on Microsoft Azure.  In simple terms, horus enables you train a forms recognizer model based on some sample documents, and then use that model to process document images to translate the data they contain into structured data. This is very early documentation - expect it to evolve significantly over the coming months.
