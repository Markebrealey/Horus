# Hints

## Create your custom labelling project

When you use the Form Recognizer custom model, you provide your own training data so the model can train to your industry-specific forms. If you're training without manual labels, you can use five filled-in forms, or an empty form (you must include the word "empty" in the file name) plus two filled-in forms. Even if you have enough filled-in forms, adding an empty form to your training data set can improve the accuracy of the model.

If you want to use manually labeled training data, you must start with at least five filled-in forms of the same type. You can still use unlabeled forms and an empty form in addition to the required data set. We will be using manually labelled training data.
